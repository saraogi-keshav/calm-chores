# Calm Chores
## MET CS 673 F24 Group 4 

Calm Chores App is going to be a chores management app for homes being shared by roommates. The app will offer a one-stop platform to manage different chores, bill payment reminders, and common house tasks. It will help rotate the chores distributed amongst roommates in a routine manner by which no one house member will be overburdened with multiple tasks. It will also feature various options to schedule chores on time, have vacation mode to alter schedules, have a to-do list for a particular room or house, and much more. The app will also feature a public page for all users, which will display ratings about the userâ€™s task completion score, this can be used as a recommendation for future references. Calm chores will help simplify chore management of shared household tasks and responsibilities.
